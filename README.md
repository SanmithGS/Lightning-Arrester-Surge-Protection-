#  Lightning Arrester (Surge Protection) – Simulink Model

Simulation of **lightning impulse (1.2/50 μs)** and protection of a 3-phase feeder using **MOV Lightning Arresters** in MATLAB Simulink.

---

##  What I Built
- 0.4 kV feeder (Source → Line → Load)
- 3-phase lightning impulse generator (1.2/50 μs)
- Controlled voltage source injection
- MOV surge arresters to ground
- Transient voltage suppression analysis
- Sending & receiving end waveform monitoring

---

##  Tools
MATLAB Simulink • Simscape Electrical

---

##  Results

**System Model**

**Lightning Injection Block**

**Receiving End**
- Small transient spike
- Voltage clamped by MOV  


**Sending End**
- High surge without protection
- Large current/voltage spike observed

##  Run
Open `.slx` → Run → Impulse applied → Observe surge suppression

---

##  Skills Demonstrated
